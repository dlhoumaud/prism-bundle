# Hybrid Scenario - YAML Part
# This YAML file defines the base data structure
# The PHP class (HybridExamplePrism.php.dist) adds complex logic on top
#
# To use this example:
# 1. Copy this file and HybridExamplePrism.php.dist, remove .dist extensions
# 2. Run: php bin/console app:prism:load hybrid_example --scope=dev

vars:
  admin: "admin_{{ scope }}"

load:
  # Base user created by YAML
  - table: users
    data:
      username: "{{ $admin }}"
      email: "{{ $admin }}@example.com"
      password: "{{ hash('secret') }}"
      created_at: "{{ now }}"
    types:
      created_at: datetime_immutable

# The PHP class will add:
# - Additional users with calculated fields
# - Complex business logic
# - Dynamic data generation
